To sum it up, self-isolation period is one of the most difficult times for people, and for students particularly. They are facing a lot of ordeals, related to studying and daily routine. The problems I have mentioned in this article are far not all the problems that students have to handle due to COVID-19 pandemic, but I found these problems most important.

James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[23] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[24] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, the coffee from Indonesia.[25] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[26]

Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[27] It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[28] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.

In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards $10 body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[29][30][31] Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[32] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.

On 13/11/2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software (FOSS), under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.[33]

Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an evangelist.[34] Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009–10, Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency.[35] This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see the Android section).

On 5/2/2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.[36]

In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based $10,000,000,1 on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin.[37]

Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers.[38]
